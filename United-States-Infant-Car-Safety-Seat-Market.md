Additionally, many customers value the ability to consult with store employees for expert advice on selecting the appropriate seat for their child's needs. The presence of various brands and models in stores allows customers to compare prices and features directly, contributing to informed decision-making. Despite the growth of online retailing, offline sales remain a major contributor to the market, particularly in regions where online shopping adoption is relatively low.

Furthermore, the increasing reliance on digital payment methods and doorstep delivery services has also driven the shift towards online purchases. The growing popularity of online shopping, combined with the convenience of home delivery, is expected to continue shaping the online sales subsegment of the market.<h2>Key Trends in the Infant Car Safety Seat Market</h2><p>Several key trends are influencing the growth and development of the U.S. infant car safety seat market.

Additionally, expanding educational campaigns on the importance of infant car safety and the proper installation of car seats present opportunities for manufacturers to engage with a broader consumer base.
