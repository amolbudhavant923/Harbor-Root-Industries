Coating fats enhance the smooth texture and glossy finish of confectionery products, providing both aesthetic appeal and improved shelf-life. They also play an important role in creating a stable barrier against humidity and temperature changes, which is vital for the packaging and distribution of confectionery items. As confectionery manufacturers strive to offer products that are both indulgent and convenient, coating fats are integral in delivering products that meet both consumer expectations and the demands of mass production.

The dairy industry is increasingly focusing on product innovation, creating flavored and functional dairy products, which rely heavily on coating fats to maintain desirable qualities. Coating fats also contribute to the mouthfeel of dairy-based desserts, improving their overall sensory experience. As consumer demand for premium and convenient dairy products grows, particularly in markets like China, India, and Japan, the dairy application of coating fats continues to expand and evolve.Other applications of coating fats in the Asia-Pacific market include their use in ready-to-eat meals, snack foods, and even non-food sectors such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
